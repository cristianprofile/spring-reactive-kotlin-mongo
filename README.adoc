# Every concepts that I learnt in a real reactive project running in production environment

This project model a simple application managing pizzas. I am a vintage programmer so  I wont try to impress you
using DDD (every talks about this buzzword but nobody knows how to implement it in real world). I'll use MVC using
classical 3 layers option: Controller+Service+Repository.

I'll use reactive programming style using Mono and Flux using Spring and Kotlin (Java is too old
to improve faster). The repository that will be used is  reactive Mongo connector.


- Non blocking application.
- All layers must be tested with 100% coverage
- I will use a lot of different operators using Mono and Flux
- Code will be improved using Kotlin extensions

## Prerequisites

* Java 8+, Docker and maven 3 installed.

## Testing controller layer

Testing spring reactive endpoints is very easy:

- Annotate your test with  @WebFluxTest

 @WebFluxTest(controllers = [PizzaController::class])
 @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
 class PizzaControllerTests

- Mock your service layer:

 @MockBean
 private lateinit var pizzaService: PizzaService

- Use webTestClient to test your controller.

   @Autowired
   private lateinit var webTestClient: WebTestClient

- Use StepVerifier to be able to test your endpoint. This element subscribes to
reactive endpoint and will retrieve the elements that you need in your asserts.
(Remember that nothing happens until a Subscriber subscribes to a Publisher, so StepVerifier does this work)

   StepVerifier.create(pizzas)
                .expectNext(pizza1)
                .expectNext(pizza2)
                .expectNext(pizza3)
                .verifyComplete()
